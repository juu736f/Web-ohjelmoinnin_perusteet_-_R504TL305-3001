        <p>Yle News was established in 1999 - the first year Finland held the rotating EU Presidency. The time was ripe for a news service that would deliver comprehensive English-language coverage about Finland for television, radio and online audiences. The first Yle News television bulletin aired on TV Channel 1 on June 7, 1999, and the final television broadcast went out on 26 February 2017. Prior to Yle News, Radio Finland produced multilingual radio programming, including news in English. Finland’s first English-language radio news aired during World War II.</p>
        <p>The unit now focuses on serving foreigners in Finland and Finland-interested audiences abroad online, on the radio, and via social media. The Yle News site covers the top domestic stories of the day in Finland, from political and business news to issues of special interest to visitors and foreigners living in Finland. The site, which draws some 200,000 monthly readers, is updated from 07.00am to 7pm weekdays and from 10am to 6.30pm on weekends. Listeners can hear All Points North, our weekly podcast.</p>
